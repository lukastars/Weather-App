# Project: Weather App â›… [Live Demo](https://lukastars.github.io/Weather-App)

### Overview
This is my take on the Weather App, I tried to make it look modern and minimalistic yet advanced and practical with extra functionalities. 
#### **Features:**
* Search for any city or country for weather and forecast data.
* You can display the daily or hourly forecast data for a given location.
* You can display the data in metric or imperial units.
* Unique weather symbols for each forecast description.

#### **Technologies Used:**
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript[ES6+]

#### **Tools:**
* Visual Studio Code
* Git and GitHub

#### **Outcome:**
* Used the `fetch API` to consume the OpenWeatherMap API
* Made use of my `Promises`, `Async/Await`, `fetch API` skills 
* Added a loader next to the search-box that shows up during the call of the API and disappear once the data is fetched
* Added animations to the app such as changing the forecast from daily to hourly and scrolling through the hourly forecast to make the UX better and smoother 
* Used **HTML5 semantic elements** for better structure and readability
* Used **CSS Flex** to create the layout
* Deepened my knowledge of **DOM manipulation**, **HTML structure**, **CSS styling subtleties** and **JS functionality** in general
* Had lots of fun with adding the animations and the loader and using the fetch API! ðŸŽ¨
